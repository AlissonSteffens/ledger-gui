This is a GUI for my ledger program.
The project is written in Typescript and uses Next.js as a framework, with Shadcn UI for the UI (Radix + Tailwind CSS).

> This project is a work in progress, and is not ready for production.

## Warning
This project only works with (my ledger-cli implementation)[https://github.com/AlissonSteffens/ledger-gui], which is a work in progress.
If you want to understand how my ledger-cli works, you can check the (documentation at the ledger-cli repository)[https://github.com/AlissonSteffens/ledger-gui].
